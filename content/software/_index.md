### Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Generalized Linear Models (hdpGLM)

<img src="/img/hdpGLM_logo.png" align="left" width="150"> <div align="justify"><br>The package implements the hierarchical Dirichlet process Generalized Linear Models proposed in the paper Modeling Context-Dependent Latent Effect Heterogeneity. The model can be used to estimate latent heterogeneity in the marginal effect of GLM linear coefficients, cluster data points based on that latent heterogeneity, and investigate if Simpsonâ€™s Paradox occurs due to latent or omitted features. It also can be used with hierarchical data to estimate the effect of upper-level covariates on the latent heterogeneity in the effect of lower-level features.</div>
